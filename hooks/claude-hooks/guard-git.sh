# --- Segment the command, then match within a segment (#284) -----------------
#
# Every rule below inspects command TEXT, so a rule written as one flat regex
# matches a word that belongs to a *different* command in the same compound
# line. That is how the force-push rule blocked
#   git push -u origin <branch> && git log origin/main -1
# — the flag came from the push, the "main" came from the log, and nothing tied
# them to the same command.
#
# Splitting on the shell's command separators and letting grep do its normal
# per-line matching scopes every rule to one command at a time, which kills that
# whole class in one place instead of per-regex. Splitting only ever narrows a
# match, so no true positive is lost: a real `git push --force origin main` has
# no separator in it and stays one segment.

#    `git reset --hard @{u}` walked straight through a rule whose message
#    claims to stop hard resets on main. Any hard reset while ON main is what
