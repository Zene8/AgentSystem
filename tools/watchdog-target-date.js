// watchdog-target-date.js — which triage day should daily-triage-watchdog.yml judge?
//
// The watchdog is scheduled at 20:00 UTC, but GitHub's own scheduler regularly fires it hours
// late under load (the workflow's cron comment documents this). A naive `today=$(date -u +%F)`
// at fire time breaks the moment lateness crosses midnight UTC: issue #254 fired at
// 2026-08-07T00:49Z — 4h49m late — computed `today=2026-08-07`, and found no daily-triage run for
// a day whose 05:00/15:00 UTC slots hadn't happened yet. False alarm, every time firing slips
// past midnight.
//
// Fix: don't ask "what day is it right now", ask "what is the most recent day whose triage
// window has already closed". The later of the two daily-triage slots is 15:00 UTC (moved from
// 13:00 by #452, to land after stage 1's real ~14:05-14:21 UTC fire time), so: if it's currently
// before 15:00 UTC, that day's window isn't closed yet — judge yesterday instead. This is robust
// to arbitrary lateness (not just a fixed "N hours ago" offset), and a fire that's merely late but
// still same-day (e.g. 20:00 -> 23:00) is unaffected since 23:00 >= 15:00.
