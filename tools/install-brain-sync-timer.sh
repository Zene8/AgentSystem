# install-brain-sync-timer.sh — run the agent-memory sync on a ~15 minute systemd --user timer (#341).
#
# The hooks in HOOK_REGISTRY cover a host with sessions on it. They do not cover Mission Control,
# which writes memory from cron with no Claude session ever open — and that is precisely the host
# that drifted until a weekly job hit ~250 conflicting nodes at once (#340). A timer is the only
# trigger that reaches a machine nobody is sitting at.
#
# User units, not system units: no sudo, and the checkout, the brain and `gh` all belong to this
# user. Lingering is enabled so the timer keeps firing after logout — same reason as
# install-actions-watchdog.sh, and the reason a plain cron entry under an interactive session
# would not have covered the failing host either.
#
#   bash tools/install-brain-sync-timer.sh              # install + start
#   bash tools/install-brain-sync-timer.sh --dry-run    # print the units, change nothing
#   bash tools/install-brain-sync-timer.sh --check      # exit 1 if the installed units drifted
