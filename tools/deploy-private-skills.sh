# deploy-private-skills.sh — ship the gitignored life-OS skills to a host and install them.
#
# skills/daily-briefing/ and skills/daily-triage/ are gitignored (.gitignore, #187): private
# life-OS content that must never hit GitHub. That means a `git clone` on the Mission Control
# server does NOT contain them, and the 07:00 daily-triage job hard-fails on a missing
# SKILL.md. This script is the transport that git deliberately isn't.
#
# Transport is tar-over-ssh, not rsync: Git Bash on Windows ships ssh but not rsync, and this
# is run from a Windows laptop as often as from Linux.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/deploy-private-skills.sh --check                  # verify THIS host only
#   bash tools/deploy-private-skills.sh --local                  # install on THIS host
#   bash tools/deploy-private-skills.sh --host <user@host>       # ship + install remotely
#   bash tools/deploy-private-skills.sh --host <user@host> --check
#
# Options:
#   --host <user@host>  Target. Omit to operate on this host.
#   --path <dir>        Remote checkout to copy into. Default: ~/dev/AgentSystem.
#   --life <dir>        Remote LIFE_REPO root to create briefings/ + closeouts/ under.
#                       Default: ~/life. Must match $LIFE_REPO on the target.
#   --local             Operate on this host (same as omitting --host).
#   --check             Verify only; copy nothing, install nothing. Exit 1 on any gap.
#   -h | --help         Show this help.
#
# Idempotent. Re-run after every edit to either skill — there is no auto-sync.
