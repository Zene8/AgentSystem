# Agent System Comparison: Current vs. crhis_agents

**Comparison Date:** 2026-05-21
**Purpose:** Identify strengths, gaps, and recommendations for each agent category

---

## 1. Orchestration / Leadership

### Current: Jarvis (CEO, Opus 4.7)
**What it does:**
- Defined as CEO with orchestration authority
- Autonomous decision on strategy, pivots, resource allocation, conflicts
- 8-step startup (parallel GitHub queries, decision synthesis)
- Weekly cadence review
- Escalation & decision authority

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Opus-class model (highest capability)
- ✅ Clear authority structure
- ✅ Decision-making focus

**Gaps:**
- ❌ Not marked as default entry agent
- ❌ No proactive dispatch (waits for conflicts)
- ❌ 8-step startup defined but not explicit
- ❌ No session logging structure

**Grade:** B+ (defined well, not fully operationalized)

---

### crhis_agents: Toni (Chief of Staff, Sonnet 4.6)
**What it does:**
- Proactive leader, agent orchestrator
- **Default entry agent** (loads on startup)
- 16-step startup checklist with parallel queries
- Daily cadence (startup, during, shutdown)
- Weekly company review
- Autonomous dispatch via GitHub Issues
- Intent-based leadership (specify intent, agent chooses method)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Default entry** (clear on startup)
- ✅ **Proactive dispatch** (initiates work, creates Issues)
- ✅ **Rich memory** (session logs with decisions, blockers, learnings)
- ✅ Explicit 16-step startup
- ✅ Coordination rules (8 explicit protocols)
- ✅ Domain ownership map
- ✅ Daily + weekly cadence
- ✅ Leadership framework documented (Marquet, Willink, Eddie's PM Law)

**Gaps:**
- ❌ Business-centric (not ideal for pure engineering)
- ❌ Less technical depth (no equivalent to Friday's TDD requirement)
- ❌ Sonnet model (not Opus)

**Grade:** A- (operationally mature, may be over-specified for engineering)

---

### Verdict
**For cross-domain, autonomous orchestration:** crhis's Toni wins by far.
**For engineering-specific orchestration:** Current Jarvis has better domain authority, but needs Toni-style operationalization.

**Recommendation:** Adopt Jarvis + add Toni's startup/dispatch/memory structure.

---

## 2. Security & Compliance

### Current: Sam (CSO, Sonnet 4.6)
**What it does:**
- Autonomous on security policies, compliance, vendor decisions
- **HARD GATE on main merges** (pre-merge security audit required)
- Pre-merge checklist: 10 items (data access, auth, credentials, PHI, compliance, audit trail, input validation, error messages, secrets, vendors)
- Blocks merge if: data validation missing, credentials in logs, auth skipped, PHI without review, new vendor without BAA, audit trail missing, encryption missing, rate limiting absent, tenant isolation compromised
- Quarterly security reviews
- Escalation: disagreement → human (CEO/CISO)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **HARD GATE on main** (non-negotiable security)
- ✅ Comprehensive pre-merge checklist
- ✅ Clear block conditions
- ✅ Quarterly deep reviews
- ✅ Strong enforcement

**Gaps:**
- ⚠️ No policy documentation (what policies exist?)
- ⚠️ No vendor BAA tracking system
- ⚠️ No compliance roadmap (SOC-2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- ⚠️ Quarterly reviews seem light for security-sensitive work

**Grade:** A (enforcement-strong, governance lighter)

---

### crhis_agents: Belissa (Chief Security Officer, Sonnet 4.6)
**What it does:**
- CSO role, policy-focused
- SOC-2, HIPAA, security policies, audit readiness
- Policy documentation, training, compliance tracking
- Audit preparation

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Governance-focused (policies documented)
- ✅ HIPAA/SOC-2 expertise
- ✅ Training programs (HIPAA training)

**Gaps:**
- ❌ No hard gate mechanism
- ❌ No pre-merge audit
- ❌ Less enforcement, more policy

**Grade:** B (strong governance, weak enforcement)

---

### Verdict
**For enforcement:** Current Sam wins decisively (hard gate > policy docs).
**For governance:** crhis's Belissa wins (policy documentation, training, compliance tracking).

**Recommendation:** Keep Sam's hard gate, add Belissa's governance structure (policy docs, training, compliance roadmap).

---

- ✅ **Type hints everywhere**
- ✅ **10 API standards** documented
- ✅ **Deployment discipline** strict (CI/CD only)
- ✅ **Pre-handoff checklist** clear

**Gaps:**
- ⚠️ Lighter than Nat (less financial depth)
- ⚠️ No revenue forecast examples
- ⚠️ Scout & Tiffany roles less detailed

**Grade:** B+ (good separation, lighter on depth)

---

### Verdict
**For business strategy:** Nat (current) has more authority. Ralph (crhis) lighter on depth.
**For sales:** Scout (crhis) is explicit. Nat (current) doesn't have sales-specific role.
**For marketing:** Tiffany (crhis) owns it. Current system has no marketing role.

**Recommendation:** 
- Keep Nat for business strategy
- Add Scout equivalent (sales pipeline, prospect research)
- Add Tiffany equivalent (marketing, content, campaigns) or use r2d2 as fallback

---

## 8. Documentation & Communications

### Current: Threepio (Comms & Docs, model unspecified)
**What it does:**
- Documentation, comms, PR descriptions, release notes, email drafts, handoffs
- (Definition thin, unclear scope)

**Grade:** D (underspecified)

---

### crhis_agents: Tiffany (Head of Marketing, includes content)
**What it does:**
- Brand, content, campaigns, website, sales collateral
- (Comms & docs secondary to marketing)

**Grade:** C (marketing-focused, not documentation-specific)

---

### Verdict
**For documentation:** Current should have Threepio specialized. crhis doesn't have equivalent.

**Recommendation:** 
- Spec Threepio fully (README, CHANGELOG, API docs, PR descriptions, email templates, handoffs)
- Add to routing rules

---

## 9. HR & Operations

### Current: (No HR role)
**Gap:** No people/operations agent.

**What it does:**
- **Keegan:** Onboarding, offboarding, HR compliance, HIPAA training, payroll coordination
- **Margaret:** Leadership meeting agendas, meeting notes, WWW tracking
- **Toni:** Cross-domain operations, Open Loops, goals, decisions

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **People management** (Keegan)
- ✅ **Operations coordination** (Toni)
- ✅ **Meeting management** (Margaret)
- ✅ **Compliance training** (HIPAA)

---

### Verdict
**For pure engineering:** Current system correct to omit HR.
**For organization with employees:** Need Keegan + Margaret equivalents.

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

**Keep from Current:**
- ✅ Friday (CTO) — architecture authority
- ✅ Sam (CSO) — hard security gate
- ✅ Ultron (Backend) — TDD/SOLID/API standards
- ✅ Astra (Frontend) — accessibility/performance
- ✅ Leo (DevOps) — infrastructure standards
- ✅ Wanda (Design) — design governance
- ✅ Pym (Database) — schema expertise

**Enhance with crhis Ideas:**
- Add Jarvis as proactive orchestrator (startup, dispatch, memory)
- Add routing rules (Toni's dispatch model)
- Add memory structure (session logs, learnings)
- Add coordination rules (cross-agent protocols)
- Add domain ownership map

**Add New (if your org has these domains):**
- ⚠️ Sales agent (Scout equivalent) if you need sales tracking
- ⚠️ Marketing agent (Tiffany equivalent) if you need campaigns/content
- ⚠️ HR agent (Keegan equivalent) if you have employees

**Result:** 
- Engineering-precise + orchestration-ready + autonomous
- Current strengths preserved + crhis coordination added
- Optionally add business/HR roles as org grows
