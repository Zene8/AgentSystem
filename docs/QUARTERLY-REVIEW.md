## Quarterly Review Checklist

### 1. Decision Quality Audit (30 min)
- [ ] Review all `[ESCALATION]` tags from the quarter — were escalations resolved appropriately?
- [ ] Review all `[REVERSAL]` tags — what caused reversals? Pattern analysis.
- [ ] Check: are domain routing rules (AGENTS.md) producing correct first-routing decisions?
- [ ] Identify any recurring conflict between agents — does routing need refinement?

### 2. Model Fit Review (20 min)
- [ ] Are the assigned models (claude-opus-4-7 for Jarvis, etc.) still appropriate for each agent's workload?
- [ ] Any new model capabilities that should be adopted?
- [ ] Any cost/performance tradeoffs worth adjusting?

### 3. Memory System Health (20 min)
- [ ] Are all 11 agents' memory files up to date (last entry within 7 days of last activity)?
- [ ] Is `.agents/AGENTS-MEMORY.md` index current?
- [ ] Any memory corruption or sync failures this quarter?
- [ ] Is the sync log (`.agents/sync.log`) showing clean runs?

### 4. Test Coverage Review (15 min)
- [ ] Current coverage % vs target (>80%)?
- [ ] Any untested domains or agents?
- [ ] Are the 5 minimum sprint tests being maintained?

### 5. Escalation SLA Compliance (15 min)
- [ ] Were all escalations resolved within defined SLAs (ESCALATION-CONVENTIONS.md)?
- [ ] Any SLA breaches? Root cause?
- [ ] Do SLA targets need adjustment based on actual data?

### 6. Hard Gate Effectiveness (15 min)
- [ ] Were all main merges reviewed by Sam?
- [ ] Any attempted bypasses (with or without Jarvis approval)?
- [ ] Is the security gate adding value — are Sam's blocks catching real issues?

### 7. Agent Performance by Domain (20 min)
- [ ] Execution time p50/p95 per agent — any outliers?
- [ ] Agents with high escalation rates — coaching needed?
- [ ] Any agents underutilized (routing not reaching them)?

### 8. Findings, Recommendations, Action Items (25 min)
- [ ] Document findings using output template below
- [ ] Assign action items with owners and due dates
- [ ] Update HANDOFF.md with next quarterly review date
