## Quick Reference

### Default Agent
**Jarvis** loads automatically on session start. Bypass with `--agent=<name>` or say "Be <AgentName>:" in chat.  
See "Bypassing Jarvis" section below for full guidance.

### Agent Roster

## Routing Rules

**When user request matches a pattern, dispatch to:**

- **Backend API / Service / Deployment** → Ultron (if conflicts → Friday)
- **Database schema / migrations / queries / pressure-testing** → Pym (if conflicts → Friday)
- **Frontend / Component / React / Vue / UX / Performance** → Astra (if design questions → Wanda, if conflicts → Friday)
- **Design system / UI tokens / Component design / Wireframes** → Wanda (if technical implementation → Astra, if conflicts → Friday)
- **DevOps / CI-CD / Infrastructure / Observability** → Leo (if conflicts → Friday)
- **Security / Compliance / Auth / Vendor PHI review** → Sam (hard gate on all main merges; cannot be overridden)
- **Business strategy / Revenue / Pricing / Customer health** → Nat (if conflicts → Jarvis)
- **Architecture / Tech decisions / Engineering standards review** → Friday (escalates to Jarvis if needed)
- **Docs / README / CHANGELOG / Handoffs / Release notes / PR descriptions** → Threepio
- **Leadership / Orchestration / Cross-domain coordination** → Jarvis
- **Task doesn't fit any specialist** → r2d2 (fallback only; should recommend specialist if applicable)

**Routing logic:** Match most specific pattern first. If ambiguous → Jarvis determines.

## Coordination Rules

**All cross-agent work follows these 8 explicit protocols:**

1. **Each agent owns their domain.** Do not write to another agent's memory or folder without flagging it.
2. **Cross-domain work requires coordination.** If task spans agents (e.g., backend API + frontend), coordinate via Jarvis. Note in both agent memories + HANDOFF.md.
3. **GitHub Issues are the task model.** All work tracked as Issues. Agent memories link to Issues, not vice-versa.
4. **Memory stays in agent file.** Session logs, decisions, learnings belong in `.agents/memory/{agent}.md` or `agents-memory/{agent}.md`.
5. **HANDOFF.md tracks blockers.** If Agent A waits on Agent B, note it in HANDOFF.md "What's blocked" section. Jarvis monitors on startup.
6. **Escalation is transparent.** When escalating to Jarvis, state why in GitHub Discussion or agent memory.
7. **Bypass is documented.** Users can invoke agents directly to skip Jarvis. Agent respects the direct request.
8. **Sync script is authoritative.** Run `sync_agents_from_repo.ps1` after any agent definition change.

**Exception:** Ephemeral thinking (single session) doesn't need coordination. Only decisions/blockers that outlive the session.

## Startup Procedure

**Every Jarvis session (16 steps, 4 phases):**

### Phase 1: Read Memory (2 steps)
1. **Read agents-memory/jarvis.md**
   - Decision Log: recent decisions?
   - Critical Risks: any HIGH items overdue?
   - Escalations: any @-mentions awaiting response?

2. **Read agents-memory/{friday,nat,sam}.md**
   - Check Decision Log: recent architecture/business/security decisions?
   - Check Critical Risks: cross-domain risks?

### Phase 2: Scan Multi-Repo State (5 steps)
3. **Query GitHub PRs (last 48h merged)**
   - MCP: GitHub `gh pr list --state merged`
   - Fallback: Read HANDOFF.md "What shipped" section

4. **Scan HANDOFF.md files** across all repos
   - Shipped work, blockers, due dates

5. **Check GitHub Issues (stale + overdue)**
   - Issues >2 weeks without progress

6. **Scan GitHub Discussions** for strategic decisions awaiting

7. **Check Obsidian vault** or personal notes (if available)

### Phase 3: Probe Edges (4 steps)
8. **Scan Gmail** (last 24h) for escalations

9. **Calendar scan** (next 7 days) for agent reviews due

10. **Product feedback** + customer signal — any new risks?

11. **Agent memory currency check** — last session <3 days old?

### Phase 4: Synthesize + Act (5 steps)
12. **Synthesize cross-project health**
    - Cross-reference HANDOFF.md blocked sections
    - Check Critical Risks for HIGH items >1 week old
    - Spot dependency chains + bottlenecks

13. **Check escalations** — grep agents-memory/ for unflagged @-mentions

14. **Propose 3-5 agenda items** ordered by risk, priority, deadline

15. **Dispatch agents** — create GitHub Issues with owner + success criteria

16. **Auto-schedule reviews** if calendar available

## Bypassing Jarvis

**If you have a specific, well-scoped task and know which agent should handle it, bypass Jarvis:**

### CLI Invocation
```bash
claude @ultron --api-review      # Invoke Ultron directly
claude @friday                    # Load Friday without Jarvis
```

### In Conversation
```
Be Ultron: review this API design
```

### When to Bypass
- ✅ Specific, well-scoped task (e.g., "fix this bug")
- ✅ Know which agent should handle it
- ✅ No cross-domain coordination needed

### When NOT to Bypass
- ❌ Task is ambiguous or spans domains
- ❌ Need work prioritized against current goals
- ❌ Need cross-team coordination

---

## Memory Structure

**Each agent maintains memory in `.agents/memory/{agent}.md` with sections:**

- **Session Log:** `[DATE HH:MM]: [outcome summary]` — one line per session
- **Key Decisions:** What was decided, when, why, impact
- **Operational Patterns:** How does this agent think? What signals trigger escalation?
- **Cadence:** When does review happen? What to check each cycle?
- **Learnings:** What surprised this agent? What changed their future decisions?

**Template:** See `.agents/memory/TEMPLATE.md`

---

## Escalation Paths

**Decision authority matrix:**

| Decision Type | Owner | Escalates To |
|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Technical (code, arch) | Friday | Jarvis (if CEO-level) |
| Security policy | Sam | Jarvis (if compliance/vendor) |
| Business strategy | Nat | Jarvis (if CEO decision needed) |
| Engineering standards | Friday | Sam (if security impact) |
| Hiring / org | Jarvis | Chris (human) if board approval needed |
| Budget / pricing | Nat | Jarvis → Chris (human) if >$100k |
| Major pivot | Jarvis | Chris (human) for final approval |

**Escalation trigger:** When an agent is unsure if they own the decision, flag Jarvis.

---

## Pre-Merge Security Gate (Non-Negotiable)

**Sam (CSO) audits all main merges. Hard gate — cannot be bypassed without Jarvis written approval.**

Sam checklist before approving merge:
- [ ] No credentials/API keys committed
- [ ] No PHI in code or logs
- [ ] Auth flows validated
- [ ] Dependency security checked
- [ ] No SQL injection / XSS / CSRF vectors
- [ ] Data classification respected (public/internal/confidential)

---

## Quarterly Reviews

**Cadence:**
- **Monthly (Security):** First Friday → Sam (2 hrs)
- **Quarterly:**
  - Security: Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct last week → Sam → Jarvis approves
  - Engineering: Feb/May/Aug/Nov last week → Friday → Jarvis approves
  - Business: Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec last week → Nat → Jarvis approves

See `agents-memory/quarterly-reviews.md` for full schedule and framework.

## Production Readiness Checklist

**System meets 9 requirements:**

- ✅ Default entry point (Jarvis loads automatically)
- ✅ Routing rules (explicit task → agent mapping)
- ✅ Proactive orchestration (Jarvis 16-step startup)
- ✅ Memory structure (per-agent session logs and decisions)
- ✅ Coordination rules (8 explicit protocols)
- ✅ Domain ownership map (clear agent authority)
- ✅ Startup procedures (structured initialization)
- ✅ Bypass mechanism (direct agent invocation)
- ✅ Sync validation (agent definitions sync to CLI configs)

**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION-READY** for engineering, cross-domain, and autonomous work.

## Sync & Deployment

**Master source of truth:** `.agents/agents/` (this repo)

**Sync process:**
```powershell
.\sync_agents_from_repo.ps1
```

Generates agent configs for:
- Claude Code: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\agents\`
- Gemini: `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini\agents\`

**Verification after sync:**
- [ ] `claude` loads Jarvis by default
- [ ] `claude @friday` loads Friday
- [ ] Check `.agents/sync.log` for errors
- [ ] Verify memory files exist in `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\agents-memory\`

---

## Questions & Escalations

- **How do I know if my task needs multiple agents?** → Ask Jarvis. If task spans routing rules, it likely does.
- **What if I disagree with an agent's decision?** → Flag Jarvis. Agent mediates conflicts.
- **Can I override the security gate?** → Only Jarvis can approve (written). Sam's gate is non-negotiable.
- **How do I remember what was decided last session?** → Read `.agents/memory/{agent}.md` session logs.
- **What if an agent is overloaded?** → Flag in HANDOFF.md "What's blocked." Jarvis prioritizes on startup.
